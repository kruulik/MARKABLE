## Coding Challenge

### Start

View [live link ](https://kruulik.github.io/MARKABLE/) or run locally:

```
npm install
npm run start 
```

The goal is to better understand the candidate’s ability to translate a given interaction animation provided by Markable’s designers into actual UX in action on the web ("frontend"). It is key to keep the UX you create as close to Markable’s provided design as possible - in a pretty way. The goal is also to better understand the candidate’s knowledge of basic intuitive interaction on a given platform. This mission is intended to be as complete as possible within 2 days.

This challenge is designed for candidates to focus on solving a specific problem using ES6 JavaScript/React + HTML + CSS - with minimal use of additional external libraries.

You are free to use any productivity tools of choice to solve the problem, such as Google, GitHub, StackOverflow, online documentation, etc. The important thing is to solve as much as possible of this challenge and as pragmatic as possible, with as good design decisions/assumptions as possible, implement as close to the animation as you can.

Bonus: HTML5 Video Player Customization
