```

Open chrome dev-tools to see redux-logger updating the store.

### About

Bootstrapped using "Create React App". Additional packages include Redux, Node-SASS, and React Transition Group. The later was used only to experiment with animating multiple components at once; the effects are easily replicable by appending css classes.

Images and data are fetched through pseudo-api-requests using a JSON file located in util/data.json
All of the data comes through this file and nothing is hard-coded into place.
